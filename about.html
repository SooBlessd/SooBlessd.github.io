<p>I am Valencia Caldwell. I am a sports fanatic and candy lover. I have a passion for education and youth.  My lifes moto is " there is not stability without a foundation." I teach my students aka my babies on a daily that  you can do anything you set your mind to with motivation and perseverance. I work in intercity where I have seen the results of poverty. Many like to tell them that you can't make you decision based off your circumstances, but in reality many of my students are already behind because of a lack of exposure.  I became interested in programming after going camping with friends. I met a girl that loves math maybe as much as I did. She began to talk to me about coding bootcamps and every since then I have been hooked learning new language. Challenge my students with different elements and exposing them to Hour of Code.  <3 <3 </p>
