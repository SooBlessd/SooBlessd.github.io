What's something subtle but important to understand about Variables and Methods? Explain why it's important and what you need to know about it.
I am a 7th and 8th grade Math teacher. With that being said I teach pre-algebra. At the beginning of the introduction you learn that in this given number sentence a variable is equal to some given number. Sometimes this variable as shapes or letters. Well, I had a student ask why wouldn't you just use the number that its equal to instead of these shapes. Its confusing.  In my head, I am think, you are more than correct. The connection that you are making is exactly what I need you to understand. 

This was no different. I had to teach myself that when a variable is set to some given thing. It will always equal that given thing.  You can substitue it in or use it interchangbly.  

Methods on the other hand are routines or procedures that you may want to implement. You can define them explitly to do anything. They can be called on or used within, but they must be defined first. They similar to a variable in the sense that you are setting something to it. So when called on it will perform something.
