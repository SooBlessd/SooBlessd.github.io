Why would you ever go into web development? Change your career right now? Are you still going to coach volleyball? Don't you enjoy teaching? These were the question that friends and family member would ask. The answer never really changed, I will always have time to do things I love. But what if I could connect all of those through my love for technology. 

When programming was presented to me, I was terrified that I would fail. But the truth is that it was a way for me to understand why failing was so important in life.  I have a new opportunity to recognize why trial and error has proved itself to be the most vital tool of success.

Learning a new language will be difficult but it will be one of the most fullfilling feelings.  Then I learned that it only last for a matter of seconds. Its the overwhelming feeling to be able to accomplish the task of building a method. Or seeing "Hello World!" for the very first time. 

I am so excited to see where these skills can really take me. I am officially in a competition with my self!
