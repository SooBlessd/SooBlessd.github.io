At some point during this journey, I thought to myself. When will it be easy? The reality of it all is that it won't be. It may become easier but never easy. Isn't that why you chose this field? You wanted a challenge. You wanted the opportunity to learn a skill that will forever make you grow. The world of technology is ever changing. In this sense in order to truly stay up with all of the changes you must first ask yourself and are you ready for the challenge. 
Its  different from any challenge that I have ever faced. It like walking into a school building, knowing that you have to sub in a classroom. There is an agenda to get through the day. Yet, even with worksheets laid out you have obstacles of some not wanting to do them because your students don't want to do them. This challenge may be looked at very differently. There is an end goal that must be achieved. 

This is no different than the art of coding. The magical skill of building a code and making it all come to life. See in this perspective you have the teachers point of view vs the substitue's point of view. Both just want the day to go smooth, but what that looks like is not quiet the same. 

I have learned that before going into any challenge I must first see others perspectives. Its an up hill mountaint that I am ready conquor.
